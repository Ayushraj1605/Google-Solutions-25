## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview of the Project
The app aims to help users manage their e-waste by finding collection centers, scheduling pickups, and educating them about recycling. React Native will be used for cross-platform development, and Google’s ecosystem will power backend services, location, and notifications.

### 1.2 Technology Stack
- **React Native**: For mobile app development (cross-platform).
- **Google Firebase**: For real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage.
- **Google Maps SDK**: For location tracking (e.g., finding collection centers).
- **Google Cloud Functions**: For serverless backend logic (optional).
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: For push notifications.
- **Google Analytics**: For app analytics and tracking user behavior.
- **Google Ads**: (Optional) For app monetization.
- **TensorFlow.js**: (Optional) For AI-based e-waste categorization.
- **Google Identity Platform**: For authentication (OAuth, Google Sign-In).
- **Express.js**: For building the app’s backend, providing API endpoints and handling business logic.

## 2. Features Overview

### 2.1 E-Waste Collection Locator
- **Google Maps SDK**: For displaying nearby e-waste collection centers.
- Filters for types of collection centers (e.g., drop-off points, recycling hubs).
- **Geolocation API**: To detect user location and provide map-based suggestions.

### 2.2 Scheduling Pickup Services
- **Google Calendar API**: For scheduling pickup times and syncing with the user's calendar.
- Backend integration using **Firebase Firestore** to track pickup requests.

### 2.3 Product Lifecycle Tracker
- **Firebase Authentication**: For creating user accounts and storing device lifecycle data.
- **Firebase Firestore**: To store user device information and recycling/reminder schedules.
- Push notifications using **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for reminders.

### 2.4 In-App Rewards System
- Implement a point system using **Firebase Firestore** to store user points and reward history.
- Integrate **Google Pay** for users to redeem points or make donations (optional).

### 2.5 Refurbish & Reuse Marketplace
- Allow users to list and buy refurbished devices.
- Use **Firebase Firestore** to manage marketplace listings and **Google Analytics** to track user engagement.

### 2.6 Educational Section
- Use static resources or **Google Drive** for storing educational documents, videos, and infographics.
- Use **YouTube API**: To integrate educational videos about e-waste and recycling.

### 2.7 Advanced Features
- **AI-based E-Waste Sorting**: Use a **TensorFlow.js** model to categorize e-waste based on uploaded images from users.
- **Carbon Footprint Tracker**: Integrate data about recycling actions and estimate the carbon footprint reduction.

### 2.8 Blogging Section
- Allow users to write and publish blogs to raise awareness about e-waste.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Store blog posts, and allow users to interact with them (commenting, sharing).
- **Firebase Authentication**: Ensure users are authenticated before posting or commenting.
- **Google Analytics**: Track which blog posts are most read and engaging.
- **Push Notifications (FCM)**: Notify users when new blogs are published or when their blog receives comments.

### 2.9 Leaderboard for Carbon Emission Reduction
- A leaderboard displaying users who have contributed the most to reducing carbon emissions by recycling e-waste.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Track each user's contributions to carbon emission reduction, based on the amount of e-waste they have recycled.
- **Google Analytics**: For tracking the overall impact and showing leader statistics.
- **Firebase Cloud Functions**: For calculating and updating carbon emissions saved in real-time.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend (React Native)
- Organize components based on features: `HomeScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, `MapScreen`, `MarketplaceScreen`, `SchedulingScreen`, `BlogScreen`, `LeaderboardScreen`.
- Use **React Navigation**: For handling navigation between screens.
- Use **React Context API** or **Redux**: For state management across components.

### 3.2 Backend (Express.js + Google Cloud/Firebase)
- **Express.js**: The backend framework to handle API requests for functionalities such as user management, blog posting, carbon emission tracking, and e-waste data processing.
- Use **Firebase Firestore**: As the database for real-time storage of user data, devices, rewards, marketplace items, blog posts, and leaderboard stats.
- Use **Firebase Authentication**: For user sign-in and management.
- **Firebase Cloud Functions**: For custom backend logic (optional, for advanced features).
- **Google Cloud Storage**: For storing media files (e.g., product images, user-uploaded files, blog post images).

### 3.3 APIs
- **Google Maps API**: To show nearby collection centers and user location.
- **Google Calendar API**: To allow users to schedule pickups.
- **Google Identity Platform**: For handling Google Sign-In and authentication.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: For sending push notifications to users.
- **Express.js API**: For backend functionality such as blog posting, carbon emission tracking, and e-waste data management.

## 4. App Flow and User Interface

### 4.1 Main Flow
- The user opens the app → Login/Register (Google Sign-In or Firebase Auth) → Home Screen → Map Screen → Marketplace Screen → Blog Screen → Leaderboard Screen → Profile Screen.

### 4.2 UI/UX Design
- Responsive design to ensure usability across different device sizes.
- Clear call-to-action buttons and intuitive navigation.
- Colors should align with the environment-friendly theme (green for recycling, clean design).
