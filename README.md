## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User opens app
2. Google Sign-In prompt
3. Firebase authentication
4. JWT token generation
5. Secure session management

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Frontend Validation → API Request → Backend Processing → Database Operation → Response → UI Update
```

### Security Measures
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption
- Input sanitization
- Regular security audits
